#Welcome to the carpark simulator
#You have 6 parking spaces in your car park
#you need to make each subroutine work to add, remove, view (check) and empty out the carpark of 6 spaces
#build a main menu in main which allows you to access each of the subroutines, passing parameters.
#make sure to be robust, make sure to use parameter passing and returns (capture them into a variable)
